This repository is used to showcase the capabilities of the Agent-Based Installation for OpenShift 4.

In this repo, you will find the essential files needed to deploy a fully operational OpenShift 4 cluster in the various topologies. You can find:
* ```sno```: a Single Node OpenShift installation;
* ```compact```: a three-node OpenShift installation where the control-plane will host the applications' workloads;
* ```ha```: a fully HA OpenShift cluster with three control-plane nodes and 2+ worker nodes.

Every topology comes with two variants:
* ```connected```: the cluster will access the internet to pull the images;
* ```disconnected```: the cluster will access a private registry to pull the images.

To generate the ISO:
* go to the OpenShift flavor of choice: ```cd <topology>/<variant>```;
* edit the manifest to match your environment;
  * hint: make a backup copy of the manifests as they will be consumed in the next step!
* generate the ISO using the command: ```openshift-install --dir . agent create image```;
* boot the generated ISO on the server(s) that are part of the cluster.
